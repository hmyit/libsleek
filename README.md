sleek is a multiplatform window framework using the Qt application framework that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac. On Windows, they will be borderless, while still featuring dwm functionality such as snap, minimize/restore animation and shadowing. On Linux and Mac they will look like regular windows, with no code changes.
